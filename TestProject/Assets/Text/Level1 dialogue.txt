[player]Can you feel it Antonio? Your end is drawing near. I'm coming for you!

[player]Getting my wife killed over some petty turf dispute...

[player]Unforgivable!

[player]Well then. I managed to sneak on to the property unnoticed, but I'll run into security soon enough.

[player]It's regrettable, but anyone who stands in the way of my revenge will have to die.
